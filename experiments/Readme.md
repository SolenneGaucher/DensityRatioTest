The files are used to simulate the experiments :

- DROP_ABC.R is used to analyse the partitioning algorithm DROP, and to obtain the results presented in Section 3.1
- Detection_Rate_BDRT.R, Detection_Rate_DRT.R, and Detection_Rate_MMD.R are used to obtain the results presented in Section 3.2, 3.3 and in the Appendix.
- HIPC_MMD_maxsize.R and HIPC_BDRT_maxsize.R are used to obtain the results presented in Section 3.4
- HIPC_signal.R is used to estimate the signal strength to test for the presence of the different cell types (see Section 3.4)
- Robustness_test.R is used to assess the robustness of DRT against a change in the distribution f_0
